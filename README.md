# Computer Vision Based Virtual Mouse
Designed a Python-based AI system using openCV for mouse control. Utilizing real-time camera input, the system detects hand landmarks and tracks gesture patterns, eliminating the need for a physical mouse. The index finger helps to track the pointer and mid-finger is used to select the point. The smoothness and frame margin can be controlled by updating the respective variables.
